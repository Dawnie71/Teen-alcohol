## Introduction 

Teens and Alcohol is my first assessed portfolio project developed to meet the learning outcomes of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp, incorporating HTML5, CSS3 & Bootstrap. Learning outcome four recommends we select a subject within mental health, and so having worked as a teacher and lecturer, in the post 16 sector. and with NEETS, usually aged 14-19, alcohol use and misuse has been a predominant issue affecting the young people I worked with.

The live project can found here: <a href="https://dawnie71.github.io/Teen-alcohol/" target="_blank">Teens and Alcohol</a>

<h3>Description<h3>
<p>THis webpage is the landing page that opens a gateway to help young people, and their families to find the most effective and indidualised support to help them manage or overcome their issues with alocohol. Unlike drugs, alcohol is legally available, once an individual turns 18, and is often portrayed in the media, and among adults as a way to socialise, to fit in, and in some cases to relieve issues.
