## Introduction 

Teens and Alcohol is my first assessed portfolio project developed to meet the learning outcomes of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp, incorporating HTML5, CSS3 & Bootstrap. Learning outcome four recommends we select a subject within mental health, and so having worked as a teacher and lecturer, in the post 16 sector. and with NEETS, usually aged 14-19, alcohol use and misuse has been a predominant issue affecting the young people I worked with.
