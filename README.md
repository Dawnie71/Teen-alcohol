## Introduction 
<a> Welcome to my first foray into building a web browser page. Historically I have taught in the NEET agenda and one of the foremost issues for young people was alcohol misuse. Aside from the obvious perils and legal challenges that arise from teenagers and alcohol generally young people have a level of self awareness and use alcohol for a number of personal reasons. I chatted with an old colleague about this project and she suggested this topic, I thought it met the objectives, and may very well be made useful down the line!

## Project Outline

Alcohol and Teens is borne out of an issue which is prevalent in our society and is particularly challenging due to it's accessibility in communities, it's portrayal in the media and the experiences children and young people have from seeing how alcohol is nused in ther own family and social settings.

Drugs are inherently viewed differently, less acceptible, illegal and anti-social, therefore drugs are viewed in a totally different way to alcohol. For so many alcohol is a way to socialise, to alleviate the days tensions, to feel part of a group and these reasons are cited by young people too. 

Adults, in some cases, struggle to regulate their alcohol use and keep it within safe boundaries. For young people and teenagers it comes with a particular issue as their use of alcohol is illegal, antisocial and comes with a stigma. That stigma can be exacerbated, and exagerated, by issues within ethnic communities and those who identify within the LGBTQ+ community.

### Key Objectives

- A positive and appropriate user experience for autistic children and families utilising effective navigation and layout
- Clear and concise presentation of content with easy to navigate options for additional information 
- Responsive design that adheres to all necessary standards and accessibility requirements
- Effective use of color and imagery ensuring consideration for the well-being of the end user
- Inclusion of user-initiated actions providing immediate feedback

## UX Design

## User Stories 

 I am a fifteen year old who needs information about help with me and my friends drink. I am beginning to think it is too much. I drink before we go out now and drink when we are out. I got spoken to by the police and need to think about stopping.

 My son has come home a few times from his friends house, smelling of alcohol. He refuses to talk to me but I have heard he has been let go from the football team.

 My husband and son have been falling out lately because my son is not taking our move well. He is hanging out with a new group of friends and has been showing up late for work, he is not completing his studies, and rumours in the community suggest he is drinking alcohol with his new friends. I am frightened but have no where to go to get help.

 I am a teacher working at a local high school and wish to be able to research information to support in my PSHE lessons. I hope to signpost my students toward a useful resource.

 I socialise with people older than myself because my friends are not gay. I'm not out to my peer group, and have struggled to make friends. I have joined a group of people who are gay but think I am older than I am.

## Colors

Color selection is a key component to any design process. I particularly wanted my web page to appeal to young people and did a search for colours that would appeal to Gen Z, the age group who my site is aimed at but when I used colours, like bright green, bright pink, yellow and teal, feedback was that the page looked childish. I therefore opted for more subtle colours.

To ensure compliance to standards, the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) (also available as extension on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colour-contrast-checker/)) was used.<br>
Both the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and the [Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast) color contrast tools were used to corroborate these results.

### Main Palette

- #184f63 charcoal
  white
  #01ffff teal
  18df83 green

## Fonts
url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Comic+Neue:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,700;1,300;1,400;1,700&family=Oxygen:wght@300;400;700&display=swap")

I chose to use Oxygen and Comic Neue, as they look less formal than the standard fonts, and this site had to offer a friendly, less formal, look. THese fonts achieve this outcome, based on user feedback.

### Wireframes

These low-fidelity wireframes have been created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to plan for the eventu8al web design for well structured content and a responsive design.

## Imagery

I opted to use stock imagery, due to the limited time of this assignment. I chose photographs from Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/search/istock/)
 
#### Navigation

I opted for navigation to a contact form. The contact form allows anyone accessing the sight to request contact from the organisation.

###Contact Form

The form is designed as a collect all. It requests contact details, and a small message to outline the issue so that an appropriate person can make contact for the most effective initial contact.


#### Footer



#### Links and Buttons

All buttons lead to the contact form.

### Responsive Design

Utilising the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) allowed for an implementation that is responsive without the need for additional CSS or media queries.

Though it took some experimentation and troubleshooting, I have been able to create a page that is fully responsive to modern standards.

## Deployment


This [GitHub](https://github.com/) project was created using the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template) ensuring all necessary dependencies were included when opening within the designated workspace on the [Gitopod IDE](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Setup a repo using this method and template:
1. Login to your GitHub profile.
2. Navigate to the Code Institute Full Template
3. Click the dropdown for 'Use this template' and select "Create a new repository"
4. Generate the necessary name and description for your repo and click 'Create repository from template'
5. Navigate to the new repo and click the green 'Open' button with the Gitpod logo<br>
**IMPORTANT - This button should only be clicked once to generate the new IDE workspace**
6. You can now work on your repository within the Code Institute Gitpod IDE workspace

Once the project repo is created, an early deployment for the live project should performed.<br>
This allows for early and continuous testing using a variety of devices, as well as the Dev Tools available within browsers.

Additional information on the deployment process can be found on the official [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)

## Testing

Testing and validation os the website was carried out throughout the course of the project.

This included regular debugging and testing using the Dev Tools as ptovided within Chrome Browser.
